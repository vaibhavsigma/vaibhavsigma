Fixed rates from 6.57% APR to 16.25% APR (with AutoPay). Variable rates from 5.84% APR to 13.64% APR (with AutoPay). SoFi rate ranges are current as of July 27, 2018 and are subject to change without notice. Not all rates and amounts available in all states. See <a href=\"https://www.sofi.com/eligibility-criteria#eligibility-personal\" target=\"_blank\">Personal Loan eligibility details</a>. Not all applicants qualify for the lowest rate. If approved for a loan, to qualify for the lowest rate, you must have a responsible financial history and meet other conditions. Your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed above and will depend on a variety of factors, including evaluation of your credit worthiness, years of professional experience, income and other factors. See <a href=\"https://www.sofi.com/personal-loans/personal-loan-rates/\" target=\"_blank\">APR examples and terms</a>. Interest rates on variable rate loans are capped at 14.95%. Lowest variable rate of 5.84% APR assumes current 1-month LIBOR rate of 2.10% plus 4.175% margin minus 0.25% AutoPay discount. For the SoFi variable rate loan, the 1-month LIBOR index will adjust monthly and the loan payment will be re-amortized and may change monthly. APRs for variable rate loans may increase after origination if the LIBOR index increases. The SoFi 0.25% AutoPay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account. Terms and Conditions Apply. SOFI RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE PRODUCTS AND BENEFITS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. To qualify, a borrower must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident in an eligible state and meet SoFi's underwriting requirements. Not all borrowers receive the lowest rate. To qualify for the lowest rate, you must have a responsible financial history and meet other conditions. If approved, your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed above and will depend on a variety of factors, including term of loan, a responsible financial history, years of experience, income and other factors. Rates and Terms are subject to change at anytime without notice and are subject to state restrictions.

Equal Housing Lender. \"Best Egg\" is a trademark of Marlette Funding LLC. All uses of \"Best Egg\" on this site mean and shall refer to \"the Best Egg personal loan\" and/or \"Best Egg on behalf of Cross River Bank, as originator of the Best Egg personal loan,\" as applicable. Loan amounts generally range from $2,000-$35,000. Offers up to $50,000 may be available for qualified customers who receive offer codes in the mail. The minimum individual annual income needed to qualify for a loan of $50,000 is $150,000. Borrowers may hold no more than two open Best Egg loans at any given time. In order to be eligible for a second Best Egg loan, your existing Best Egg loan must have been open for at least six months. Total existing Best Egg loan balances must not exceed $50,000. All loans in MA must exceed $6,000; in OH must exceed $5,000; in GA must exceed $3,000; in NM must exceed $2,500. The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is the cost of credit as a yearly rate and ranges from 5.99%-29.99%, which may include an origination fee from 0.99%–5.99%. Any origination fee on a 5-year loan will be at least 4.99% and is deducted from loan proceeds. The APR offered will depend on your credit score, income, debt payment obligations, loan amount, loan term, credit usage history and other factors, and therefore may be higher than our lowest advertised rate. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, such as borrower default or payment extensions/modifications, 3-year payment plans may have a minimum repayment period of zero months and a maximum of 36 months and 5-year payment plans may have a minimum repayment period of zero months and a maximum of 60 months. Borrowers should refer to their loan agreement for specific terms and conditions. A loan example: a 5–year $10,000 loan with 9.99% APR has 60 scheduled monthly payments of $201.81, and a 3–year $5,000 loan with 5.99% APR has 36 scheduled monthly payments of $150.57. Requests for the highest loan amount may result in an APR higher than our lowest advertised rate. You need a minimum 700 FICO&reg; score and a minimum individual annual income of $100,000 to qualify for our lowest rate. Your verifiable income must support your ability to repay your loan. Upon loan funding, the timing of available funds may vary depending upon your bank's policies. By entering your email address, you are opting in to receive updates, notifications and special offers from Best Egg and its affiliates, agents, service providers or assignees (and any of its assignee's affiliates, agents or service providers) and, with your consent, one or more lending partners.

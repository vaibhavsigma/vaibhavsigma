Loan approval and actual loan terms depend on your ability to meet our credit standards (including a responsible credit history, sufficient income after monthly expenses, and availability of collateral). OneMain charges origination fees. Depending on the state where you open your loan, the origination fee may be either a flat amount or a percentage of your loan amount. Flat fee amounts vary by state, ranging from $25 to $400. Percentage-based fees vary by state ranging from 1% to 10% of your loan amount subject to certain state limits on the fee amount. Maximum APR is 35.99%, subject to state restrictions. APRs are generally higher on loans not secured by a vehicle. Loan proceeds cannot be used for postsecondary educational expenses as defined by the CFPB’s Regulation Z such as college, university or vocational expenses; for any business or commercial purpose; to purchase securities; or for gambling or illegal purposes. Current OneMain Customers: The above offer assumes that you do not have a current loan with OneMain or one of its affiliates. If you apply for the offer, a OneMain representative will discuss options available for current customers. Additional conditions for secured loans: Secured loans require a first lien on a motor vehicle that meets our value requirements, titled in your name with valid insurance. Active duty military, their spouse or dependents covered by the Military Lending Act may not pledge any vehicle as collateral. If you are covered by the Military Lending Act, you are not eligible for secured offers.",

Best Egg loans are unsecured personal loans made by Cross River Bank, a New Jersey State Chartered Commercial Bank, Member FDIC. \"Best Egg\" is a trademark of Marlette Funding, LLC. All uses of \"Best Egg\" refer to \"the Best Egg personal loan\" and/or \"Best Egg on behalf of Cross River Bank, as originator of the Best Egg personal loan,\" as applicable. The term, amount and APR of any loan we offer to you will depend on your credit score, income, debt payment obligations, loan amount, credit history and other factors. Your loan agreement will contain specific terms and conditions. The timing of available funds upon loan approval may vary depending upon your bank policies. Loan amounts range from $2,000-$35,000. Residents of Massachusetts have a minimum loan amount of $6,500; New Mexico and Ohio, $5,000; and Georgia, $3,000. For a second Best Egg loan, your total existing Best Egg loan balances cannot exceed $50,000. Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) range from 5.99%-29.99%. The APR is the cost of credit as a yearly rate and reflects both your interest rate and an origination fee of 0.99%-6.99% of your loan amount, which will be deducted from any loan proceeds you receive. The origination fee on a loan term 4-years or longer will be at least 4.99%. Your loan term will impact your APR, which may be higher than our lowest advertised rate. You need a minimum 700 FICO score and a minimum individual annual income of $100,000 to qualify for our lowest APR.
